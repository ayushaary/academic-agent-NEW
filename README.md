# 🔮 FutureYou AI — Academic Twin

FutureYou AI is an **Agentic Academic Assistant** that predicts a student’s future SGPA, simulates optimized academic paths, and provides real-time guidance through an integrated AI chatbot.

The idea behind this project is simple:

> *What if you could get an idea about your academic future — and try change it today?*

This system combines Machine Learning, Agent-based optimization, and a conversational AI interface to help students make better academic decisions.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📊 SGPA Prediction (ML)

Predicts **next semester SGPA** using a trained XG Boost model based on:

- Study time  
- Absences  
- Health level  
- Family & school support  
- Lifestyle habits  
- Previous semester SGPA  

---

### 🤖 Agentic Optimization

Prediction alone isn’t enough.

An **Academic Agent** simulates multiple futures:

- Study +1 / +2 / +3 hours  
- Reduce absences  
- Improve health  
- Lifestyle changes  

It evaluates each scenario and automatically selects the **best action** that maximizes SGPA improvement.

You get:

- Predicted SGPA  
- Optimised SGPA  
- Best recommended action  
- All alternative futures  

---

### 🔥 Personalized Recommendation

After simulation, the system highlights:

- The most impactful change  
- Why it matters  
- How much SGPA improvement it gives  

---

### 💬 Academic Chatbot

An embedded chatbot allows students to ask:

- “How can I improve my GPA?”  
- “Give me study tips”  
- “How do I manage time better?”  

Powered using **OpenRouter (DeepSeek R1T Chimera)**.

Works like ChatGPT directly inside the app.

### 🛠 Local Setup (Optional)

If you want to run locally:

### 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ayushaary/academic-agent-NEW.git

cd academic-agent-NEW

### 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run app
streamlit run app.py

---

### ☁️ Deploy on Streamlit Cloud 
**Step 1 — Open Streamlit Cloud**

Go to:

👉 https://share.streamlit.io/

Login using GitHub.

**Step 2 — Create New App**

Click New App.

Fill:

**Field	-** Value

**Repository -** ayushaary/academic-agent-NEW

**Branch -**	main

**Main file path -**	app.py

Click Deploy.

Streamlit will automatically:
 - Create Python environment
 - Install dependencies from requirements.txt
 - Launch your app

---

### How to Use the App

 - Open the deployed Streamlit link.
 - Fill in your academic details from the left sidebar:
      - Study time, travel time, free time, social time.
      - Previous SGPA (G1, G2).
      - Health, absences, support indicators, etc.
 - Click Simulate Future.

**You’ll see:**

 - Predicted SGPA (Next Semester) — XG Boost output
 - Optimised SGPA — Agent-simulated best future
 - Best Action — highest impact improvement
 - All Agent Futures — alternative scenarios
 - Use the Academic Chatbot at the bottom to ask questions about study habits, GPA improvement, or time management.

---

### How It Works

**ML Prediction**
 - XGBoost model predicts baseline SGPA using student features.

**Agent Simulation**
 - Multiple “what-if” actions are applied (study + hours, fewer absences, better health, etc.).
 - Each scenario is re-evaluated.
 - The agent selects the action with maximum SGPA gain.

**Chatbot (using API)**
 - Chatbot calls OpenRouter using a private API key (stored as Streamlit Secret).
 - Frontend never sees the API key.
 - User queries are sent to OpenRouter (DeepSeek Chimera).
 - Responses are shown directly in the Streamlit UI.

### Known Limitations
 - Model trained on a limited dataset.
 - Chatbot responses depend on free API quota.
 - SGPA predictions are indicative, not guaranteed outcomes.

---

### Future Improvements
 - Burnout / fatigue modeling.
 - Mental health scoring.
 - Calendar integration.
 - User login + saved profiles.
 - Better mobile UI
